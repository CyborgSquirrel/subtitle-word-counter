1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,940
There is... a house... in New Orleans

2
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:21,860
They call the Rising Sun

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,200
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,160
And God, I know I'm one.

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:43,200
[Instrumental]

6
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,120
My mother was a tailor!

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,440
She sewed my new blue jeans!

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,400
My father was a gamblin' man!

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,580
Down in New Orleans

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,160
Now the only thing a gambler needs,

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,600
Is a suitcase and trunk!

12
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,900
And the only time he'll be satisfied

13
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,980
Is when he's on a drunk

14
00:01:37,980 --> 00:02:20,680
[Instrumental]

15
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,620
Oh mother...

16
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,500
Tell your children,

17
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,820
Not to do what I have done!

18
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:37,820
Spend your lives in sin and misery!

19
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,280
In the House of the Rising Sun

20
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:52,600
[Instrumental]

21
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,820
Well, I got one foot on the platform!

22
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,480
The other foot on the train!

23
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:10,100
I'm goin' back to New Orleans,

24
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,100
To wear that ball and chain!

25
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:24,000
[Instrumental]

26
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,880
Well, there is a house in New Orleans!

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They call the Rising Sun!

28
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,420
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy!

29
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,120
And God I know I'm one

30
00:03:46,360 --> 00:00:00,000
[Instrumental]
